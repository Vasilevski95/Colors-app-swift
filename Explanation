# Colors-app-swift

This is a simple iOS app called "Colors-app" that displays a table view of randomly generated colors. 
When a user taps on a color, the app navigates to a detail view controller that shows the selected color. Let's go through the code file by file:



ColorsTableVC.swift:

This file defines a view controller class ColorsTableVC that displays a table view of colors.
colors is an array of UIColor objects that will be displayed in the table view.

Cells and Segues are enums that define identifiers for the table view cells and segues.

viewDidLoad is a method that gets called when the view controller loads. In this case, it calls addRandomColors to populate the colors array with 50 randomly generated colors.

addRandomColors is a method that generates 50 random colors and adds them to the colors array.

prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) is a method that gets called when a segue is about to be performed. 
In this case, it sets the color property of the destination view controller (ColorsDetailsVC) to the color of the selected table view cell.
This is done using the sender parameter, which is passed in when the segue is performed.

The extension ColorsTableVC: UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource extends the view controller to conform to the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols. 
These protocols define methods that control the behavior of the table view.

tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:) is a method that returns the number of rows in the table view. In this case, it returns the number of colors in the colors array.
tableView(_:cellForRowAt:) is a method that returns a table view cell for a given row. 
In this case, it dequeues a reusable table view cell with the identifier Cells.colorCell and sets its background color to the color at the corresponding index in the colors array.
tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:) is a method that gets called when a table view cell is selected. 
In this case, it gets the color at the selected row and performs a segue to the detail view controller (ColorsDetailsVC), passing the color as the sender parameter.



ColorsDetailsVC.swift:

This file defines a view controller class ColorsDetailsVC that displays a single color.
color is a property that holds the color to be displayed.

viewDidLoad is a method that gets called when the view controller loads. 
In this case, it sets the background color of the view to the color property if it is not nil. If color is nil, it sets the background color to blue.



UIColor+Ext.swift:

This file defines an extension of the UIColor class that adds a static method random() that generates a random color. 
The method returns a UIColor object with random RGB values between 0 and 1, and an alpha value of 1.


That's it! This app generates random colors and displays them in a table view, allowing the user to select a color to view in more detail.
